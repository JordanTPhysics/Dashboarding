   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8050/`.

3. **Explore the Dashboard:**
   Use the interactive elements to filter, zoom, and explore the data visualizations.

## Configuration

- **Datasets:** Place your datasets in the `data/` directory or configure the data source in `config.py`.
- **Settings:** Customize dashboard settings (such as layout, theme, etc.) in the `config.py` file.
- **Adding New Visualizations:** Extend the `plots.py` file with new plot types by following the existing structure.

## Examples

The repository includes several example datasets and dashboards:

- **Example 1:** Visualizing stock market data with line charts.
- **Example 2:** Exploring population growth using bar charts and heatmaps.

To view these examples, simply run the application and select the desired example from the dashboard menu.
