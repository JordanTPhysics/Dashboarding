# Dashboarding

This repository uses the Google Places API found here https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/text-search to scrape and clean place data found on Google Maps. It can be used for trip planning or as a tool to locate local businesses for marketing. There is a front-end API built with Next and ChartJS for data visualization.
