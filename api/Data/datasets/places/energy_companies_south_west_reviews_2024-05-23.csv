The engineer (James) who Installed our boiler was very polite and helpful, he gave time to answer questions and provide instructions on how to use the boiler. When the work was completed he left the property clean and tidy. Once the boiler was installed the electric work followed, and that was also done in a timely and professional manner. I want to also Thank Stephanie from the Customer Service team, she was very polite, professional and helpful, and the directors were also very helpful as well. I would highly recommend this company :)",2023-08-09T19:46:39Z

ChIJX-MHEFsNe0gRXCoC5d1Mo2o,5,"I recently had the pleasure of having solar panels installed on my roof by Eco Renewables Group Limited, and despite encountering some minor hiccups, I must say that the overall experience was excellent, thanks to the efforts of Chris, the Director.

The installation process began with Mark, who is regarded as their top electrician. While I appreciate the hard work and dedication, I noticed that his work was rushed and some details were left incomplete. I raised this concern with Chris, and to my surprise, he took immediate action to rectify the situation. He assured me that he would get it sorted to high standards that Eco Renewables Group Limited are well known for.

Although it did take a little time to get the skirting sorted, I was more than impressed with the level of commitment Chris and Marcus displayed. They truly went above and beyond to turn my solar roof into something akin to a sleek Tesla roof. Their attention to detail and dedication to achieving a flawless finish were evident throughout the process. I couldn't have been happier with the final result. The solar panels looked seamless and aesthetically pleasing, enhancing the overall appearance of my home.

Moreover, I appreciate how Eco Renewables Group Limited values customer satisfaction. Chris's willingness to listen to my concerns and take swift action demonstrated that their commitment to providing top-notch service is more than just a marketing claim.

In conclusion, I highly recommend Eco Renewables Group Limited for solar panel installation, thanks to the outstanding efforts of Chris amd Marcus & team (roofers). While the initial work may have faced some challenges, their dedication, attention to detail, and commitment to excellence turned the experience into a resounding success. My sleek solar roof is a testament to their expertise and customer-focused approach.",2023-07-21T11:48:42Z

Ryan has a great skill in answering any questions in plain simple language. We placed an order for panels, inverter and storage batteries.

Any questions they are always happy to help.Highly Recommended",2023-07-14T12:42:57Z
ChIJX-MHEFsNe0gRXCoC5d1Mo2o,5,"Very pleased with the Solar panels, battery and system installed by Eco Renewables. Had it for over a year now and it has performed even better than the estimate at installation. Saved significant money on electricity and the payback for the system is only 7 years.",2023-12-13T13:28:30Z
ChIJoygihrpdeUgRSugGzIQviO4,4,"Thanks John and his team to install 6 Solar panels and a 5.8 kwh battery with a fair price. The installation has been smooth and left clean. My energy usage has already dropped 1/3 in summer time, when I receive my export MPAN my energy bill will drop further.

Will contact John again to extend my system when I save enough to extend my roof.",2023-07-14T23:36:51Z

ChIJXSydBmGRcUgRXchpU2DWdbM,5,Can’t beat any other company with the life time warranty they provide! Professional fast and amazing customer service! Highly recommended.,2023-03-29T10:38:01Z
ChIJXSydBmGRcUgRXchpU2DWdbM,5,"Great product and service.

Life time warranty on solar panels and inverters and 10 year’s warranty on batteries makes this company 100x better value than any other company, even if they are slightly more expensive.

Came and fitted within 2 weeks after a face to face appointment and survey all regulated by an external company so you know exactly what you will produce and get.

Able to see how much money I will be saving plus east finance option which is cheaper than my current utility bill absolute no brainier in the current climate.",2023-03-29T10:48:01Z
