ChIJZdCEnuy3e0gRhuS7Kh7C2Ag,5,"Assalamu alaikum,

Dear volunteers and team at EIC. I just wanted to express my written gratitude to each of you including our dear Imam Muhammad, Shaykh Fahim, Shaykh Muhammad Saleh, Ustadh Nouman and every single volunteer who made this Ramadan a tremendously smooth spiritually uplifting month full of khayr.

May Allah swt allow it to weigh heavy on your scale of good deeds and a means by which we all attain maghfirah and jannatul firdaus through His Mercy.

From the beautiful Quran recitation, to the class from Ustadh Nouman at the end, the delicious iftaars, the organised car parking, the well maintained cleanliness of the bathrooms, the openness to families especially younger children, the cr√®che facilities upstairs and everything in between. Firstly, we thank Allah (swt) and secondly each of you including those behind the scenes who many may not see but Allah (swt) knows about.

JazakumAllah khayr",2024-04-15T22:44:27Z
