              "text": "When I moved to London in October of last year, I found this gem when looking for a gym in my area. I had never done martial arts before and worried that doing something so different to my previous disciplines (swimming, rowing, triathlons) would be intimidating and unfruitful, but I found Professor Oliveira, as well as the whole group, to be supportive, passionate, and welcoming. BJJ is nothing to take lightly, so expect to be humbled and called out if you're slacking, but I highly recommend giving it a go if you've never done it before. This gym is genuinely one of the reasons that I settled so comfortably into London, as it gave me a community.\n\nIf you are a woman that is looking for a BJJ gym, just know that there are few other women at the club and that other clubs in London may be better suited if the ratio of men to women is important to you, but Professor Oliveira is very attentive in making sure the men treat you with respect and care. This is very much a smaller gym than others I've encountered in London, meaning that the timetable is more limited, but if the schedule works with your lifestyle, you'll find the membership is one of the best in regards to pricing in London.\n\nOss :)",

              "text": "When I moved to London in October of last year, I found this gem when looking for a gym in my area. I had never done martial arts before and worried that doing something so different to my previous disciplines (swimming, rowing, triathlons) would be intimidating and unfruitful, but I found Professor Oliveira, as well as the whole group, to be supportive, passionate, and welcoming. BJJ is nothing to take lightly, so expect to be humbled and called out if you're slacking, but I highly recommend giving it a go if you've never done it before. This gym is genuinely one of the reasons that I settled so comfortably into London, as it gave me a community.\n\nIf you are a woman that is looking for a BJJ gym, just know that there are few other women at the club and that other clubs in London may be better suited if the ratio of men to women is important to you, but Professor Oliveira is very attentive in making sure the men treat you with respect and care. This is very much a smaller gym than others I've encountered in London, meaning that the timetable is more limited, but if the schedule works with your lifestyle, you'll find the membership is one of the best in regards to pricing in London.\n\nOss :)",

I was new to the area, but it was not too hard to find the location. It took about 30 minutes train ride from Barbican to Hammersmith station for about 2.6 pounds. When I got out of the station, I made a right turn. Then I saw a coffee shop in a triangular corner with the masters’ pictures by the window. The lady inside smiled at me, so I knew that I was nearby. I keep following the Hammersmith Grove and saw the logos, the gym is right there by a bus stop.\n\nThe staff were very friendly. The professor was very welcoming and professional. The facility was very clean and well-designed. Training partners were very kind. I even met a lady from the US who was also visiting. Rental gi was 10 pound. I am very thankful to have the opportunity to learn and train at Roger Gracie. I definitely will recommend to all my family and friends.",

Since joining i have consitently attended 3-4 sessions for the past 5 months, and I have noticed a huge improvement in my BJJ knowledge and ability due to Junior's mentorship and teaching style. Junior always has top level international and national black belts come in to teach us and give us a different perspective. Junior is one of the kindest and understanding people I have come across. He instills trust and accountability with everyone who trains at the gym and this makes the gym feel more like a family, rather than just training partners.\nThe atmosphere in the gym is great and everyone helps each other out with learning and improving on individual game. Everything from warmup to drilling are based on positions and situations that apply directly to sparring.\nI would recommend the gym to everyone, even if your goal is fitness and not BJJ....after one session of BJJ at ACTJJ you will find yourself wanting to join as a permanent member!\nThank you Junior for your continued mentorship, I am looking forward to what the future holds for ACTJJ and the amazing team we have.",

This isn't something a membership can buy. Having a positive atmosphere is a huge thing for me. No unnecessary distractions means more time concentrating on what I'm there to do. Fantastic set up!

              "text": "I've been attending this gym for two months now and this is a review I would like to read two months ago when I was looking for any information about the gym.\n\nAbout me. I'm a white belt with two stripes. This is my second BJJ gym. The previous one I was attending for two years (not always regularly). Due to a house move, I needed to find a new gym here. I googled and I found ACTJJ UK school, fairly close (10mi.) and matched in general what I was looking for - a traditional Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu gym. I contacted Luciano on Facebook and a week later I was attending the first class.\n\nLuciano Junior, the head coach, is a Brazilian black belt, who runs ACTJJ UK. He is a humble, positive guy. It's his sole effort, that makes the gym what it is now - a good and a quality traditional BJJ gym. Luciano is a black belt under Alessandro Xaruto 4th degree black belt, who runs ACTJJ in Brazil.\n\nAt the moment there are BJJ classes and a few types of fitness/crossfit classes. I haven't tried these fitness/crossfit classes, but I've seen a few videos and they look amazing. The BJJ classes have a typical structure: warmup, techniques and sparring matches, if there is enough time. In terms of types of BJJ classes, there are classes for beginners, advanced and mixed. All are with Gi, at the moment there are no no-Gi classes. One thing related to the class structure I like is that every class during warmup Luciano matches people, so they don't randomly pair themselves. I don't know his reasons for doing it (I'll ask later), but I think, sometimes is about picking people with the right skill, so one could challenge another one but not dominate it, or picking people so one could mentor another one. Either way, it is better than random matching.\n\nThe team is really friendly. Gens and lads range in age from late-teens to late-40. The gym is still young, I think it is 1.5, maybe 2 years old. In consequence, there are not many highly ranked belts. Personally, I don't find it a negative, but well, I'm a white belt. If you are a purple, brown or black belt, you might not find a challenging opponent besides Luciano.\n\nComparing to my previous BJJ gym, in terms of the quality of classes and the friendliness of the team, I would say this gym is better. In terms of quality, the classes are made by a black belt. It is not always the case in the other gyms. But even comparing to classes of black belts I attended, I prefer Lucianos. In terms of friendliness, you feel accepted from day one. You feel like a part of this new family very quickly. In other gyms, it's not always the case. In some gyms, you need to deserve acceptance. The big gyms, even they have the family thing, you might need years to really feel you are a part of it.\n\nThe two things I miss might be specific to my preferences, still worth mentioning. The first is some kind of a shower room to cool down and clean yourself (I think it is in progress, but not 100% sure about that).\nThe other thing I miss is having more morning classes. There is only one morning class on Tuesdays. Still, I understand that. First of all, the gym is still growing - there is only one coach, and you have to make some trade-offs. On top of that, the interest is not huge to attend in the morning. If more people were choosing mornings, there would be more morning classes. Simple. It is how it is 🙂\n\nOverall, this is a very good BJJ gym. I can recommend it.",
