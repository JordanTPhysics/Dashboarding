ChIJBbl6eltNekgRCFImSfK9a5M,5,Had a phone call from Greg last week and he explained the various options available to us since Green Energy stopped trading and EDF took over. They had put us on a variable tariff and Greg advised us of our options with other suppliers. We settled on a new supplier and on a tariff which will suit us very well.

ChIJ__8PEcGxe0gRYjFuJZN5LbI,1,"I'd advise to avoid where possible.

On the 2nd April 2024, we reached out to Utility Bidder in order to assist us in finding a better rate for our gas and electric supplier at our commercial property.

I spoke with, who I thought, was a great member of staff - really helpful. Little did I know, it was just part of their sales tactics.

They first started by getting the best possible prices from our current supplier, before tendering our requirements out to their network.

Within a few minutes, she come back to me with prices (which weren't too bad in all honesty).

In the meantime, I said I was going to be speaking to my existing supplier to find out their best prices - the colleague I spoke with informed me she already had done, and they were the initial prices and not to contact them (I was confused as to who she spoke with initially).

In the meantime, I'd already poke with my existing supplier and requested a price from them, but because their member of staff told me that they'd alreadyspoke to them and got the prices, I continued to enter an agreement with Utility Bidder and our new supplier.

I then received the prices from my current supplier, who came in a A LOT cheaper than Utility Bidder had actually told me (when I mean cheaper, I mean over 75%). When I queried this, I was informed by their customer service that my supplier wouldn't put me on this contract due to me having a low credit score (due to being a new business).

I checked with my supplier if the credit check would impact the decision on me taking out this new contract, where I was informed that the credit check WOULD NOT impact the new prices and contract.

So, in conclusion - I was lied to by two members of Utility Bidder's staff in order to get me to stick with them, than my existing supplier.

If you do use them, do your own due diligence and ignore what they say until you have your own evidence to show that they are cheaper.",2024-04-03T16:31:10Z

ChIJfYAF5kXqeUgRqcfICc508I8,1,"I run a small Company with high gas usage and received the enclosed:

""We recently sent this email to you which unfortunately was missing some elements of your account's details, please find below your revised update.

As you know, the last year has been extremely challenging for all businesses. One such impact of these exceptional events is that they have created significant additional costs for the supply of your energy. We have done everything we can to mitigate this financial impact and to date, we have absorbed these additional costs into our agreed energy supply rates. In light of the significant and ongoing situation, it is regretfully unsustainable for us to continue to absorb these additional costs.

We‚Äôre getting in touch with you as your energy consumption for the period 10/02/2020 to 09/08/2022 is significantly different from your estimated yearly consumption. Consequently, we are writing to advise you of some additional reconciliation fees you will receive in your next bill and the options available to help you mitigate the impact of these charges.
What are Reconciliation Fees?
At the start of your contract, we set your agreed supply rates based on the estimated yearly consumption figures that you provide us. We purchase energy based on these consumption figures to ensure you get a competitive price in line with available market rates at that time, giving you certainty over your energy prices for the duration of your contract.

In clause 11 of our Business Terms & Conditions, we advise Corporate Business customers that there is a reconciliation fee that will be incurred if your consumption is outside the range of 90/110% of your estimated yearly energy usage.  This charge reflects the additional costs incurred if we have to balance your energy requirements outside of this tolerance range, either purchasing the shortfall from the market or selling the surplus energy at a price different to that when the contract was agreed. The reconciliation charges we calculate use the actual market prices observed during the period of the calculation. Many business energy suppliers have similar clauses in their contracts.

What this means for you
As your energy consumption for the period is outside of your contracted tolerance limit of 90/110, your account is due to incur a reconciliation fee of ¬£330.84. These charges will be applied to your next bill.""
