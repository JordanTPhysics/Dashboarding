ChIJe45rnYuze0gRDWcSc7clP8E,5,"I cannot express enough how fantastic my experience has been at Factory. From the moment I walked through the doors, I felt welcomed and encouraged. Adam and the other coaches here are not just experts in BJJ but also fantastic teachers. They break down complex techniques into manageable steps, making it accessible for beginners while challenging advanced practitioners to push their limits.

The facilities are superb. It's clean, well-maintained, and has all the equipment you could possibly need. They've created a safe and inclusive environment where people of all skill levels and backgrounds can come together to learn and grow.

What I think sets Factory apart is the sense of camaraderie among the members. Everyone is genuinely supportive and willing to help each other improve. It might sound cheesy but It's not just a gym, it's a family. Training here has not only improved my physical fitness but also my mental resilience and confidence.

The class schedules are flexible, with days and evening classes accommodating even the busiest of schedules. Whether you're a working professional, a student, or a parent, you'll find a suitable class time.

In addition to regular classes, Factory offers various seminars and special events. These are incredible opportunities to learn from world-class instructors and deepen your knowledge of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

If you're considering learning BJJ, I highly recommend giving Factory a try. I'm proud to be a part of this incredible community, and I look forward to many more years of training and growth here.",2023-09-08T13:38:13Z

Straight away you‚Äôre made to feel welcome by professor Mike and his coaches, and there is a great atmosphere in the gym.

The lessons are brilliant and everything is explained in a way that makes it easy for brand new white belts to understand.

The higher belts are always happy to offer advice and encouragement to new starters, and it makes you feel like part of the team from day 1.

Whether you‚Äôre just looking to train improve your health & fitness, or want to train seriously to compete, I can‚Äôt recommend the place highly enough.

As soon as my kids are old enough I‚Äôll be signing them up to the junior classes!

Thanks Mike & the team at RGA Salford!",2023-05-09T12:26:58Z
