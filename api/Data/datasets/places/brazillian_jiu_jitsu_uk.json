I have so many different training partners and they each teach me something new every time. As a severe introvert, over this time I learned new physical skills as well as social skills. In this time I’ve grown as an individual in so many ways and I’ve also done 2 interclubs, coming to my third next week. My intentions when I came here weren’t oriented toward competing or anything of the sort but I find that’s where I’m headed because of the quality of the training I receive here.\n\nCoach Darren and Coach Rick are the main coaches and are truly brilliant. Salford MMA isn’t just a gym, it’s a community, I might even go so far as to say it’s a family, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to explore their curiosity in the field.\n\nThey offer BJJ, no-gi grappling, wrestling, kickboxing, Muay Thai and more, but these are my personal favourites. Also, they have loads of bags, a cage, a ring, large matted areas, a big gym equipped area, a decent changing room for women and just awesome people. I love this place :)",

As someone who started out as a novice on their intro course and now proudly wears a blue belt, I can confidently say that Pulga has played an instrumental role in my journey as a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioner.\nFirst and foremost, let's talk about the coaching. The level of instruction at Pulga is unparalleled. The coaches are not only highly skilled but also incredibly passionate about sharing their knowledge. Their dedication to each student's growth is evident in every class, whether you're a beginner like I once was or a seasoned competitor aiming for the next level.\nWhat truly sets Pulga apart is its diverse community. The gym welcomes individuals of all abilities, ages, and genders, creating a rich tapestry of talent and camaraderie. Training alongside people from varied backgrounds and skill levels has not only expanded my understanding of BJJ but also enriched my overall experience.\nIf you just want to learn some skills for self-defence or set off on a journey to become a Black Belt you will find your place at the gym.",

The coaches make it really fun and they get a taste of starting to line up & listen, as well as practice some moves with coaches helping. Highly recommend.\nMy son has trained for nearly 3 yrs, the difference in his confidence & fitness is fantastic. The coaches are friendly &   supportive & the club feels like a real community, also teaching the kids values like integrity & discipline. Lots of classes throughout the week for both adults & kids, so it’s also flexible for fitting it in to busy schedules.",

The coaches make it really fun and they get a taste of starting to line up & listen, as well as practice some moves with coaches helping. Highly recommend.\nMy son has trained for nearly 3 yrs, the difference in his confidence & fitness is fantastic. The coaches are friendly &   supportive & the club feels like a real community, also teaching the kids values like integrity & discipline. Lots of classes throughout the week for both adults & kids, so it’s also flexible for fitting it in to busy schedules.",

A few of the reasons we love the place:\n\n- The culture of the academy is fantastic. It is built upon respect, discipline, community striving for excellence, and a very strong ethos of lifting others up and growing together. The coaches and academy staff embody these values without exception.\n\n- The quality of teaching is outstanding. You can develop at your own pace and the timetable is really comprehensive meaning you can fit in classes no matter how busy you are. This applies for both the kids and adult classes.\n\n- The academy is constantly giving back to the local community with things like training, sponsorship, toy collections to mention a few.\n\nI’ve seen a huge change in my daughter since she’s been at GBRL - more confident, self assured and we’ve both made some great friends as well. Love this place and can’t recommend it highly enough 🙏🏽",

I was already impressed with what I had seen virtually over zoom however since he has started with classes in person I'm even more impressed.\n\nAmazing set up, great atmosphere and brilliant place to not only learn Brazilian jiu-jitsu but also great life skills too. My son loves his classes that are mixture of fun games and technique that are really well structured.\n\nThe team at Gracie Barra Roundhay are super friendly and do a great job.",

The team have carefully created a wonderful environment for learning and self-development. From the excellent facilities (which include a coffee area complete with a mini library) to the skilled coaching team it comes together to make learning Brazilian Jiu Jitsu not only safe but fun. The timetable and classes are varied with sessions in the morning, lunch and evening which means you can train around your schedule. The structure of the classes and quality of the coaching make each session fun and engaging and the time flies by. So If you want to extend your session then you can make use of the well-stocked gym or recover in the sauna or ice bath.\n\nIt’s difficult to distil the impact it has had on me in a few short sentences but I’ll do my best. Some of things you might expect from learning Jiu Jitsu, my strength and mobility has significantly improved and my overall physical health is better. But other benefits have come from unexpected places. As a safe space to grow, the academy have cultivated an incredible and truly unique community and I am insanely proud to be part of it. I have found friendship and support from a team that inspire me to be better in every way. Even the way the academy commit to continual improvement and giving back to the community has inspired me to apply this to my own profession.\n\nI urge anyone who might on the fence to give it a try. Every single one of us knows what is like to walk through those doors for the first time so you can expect a warm welcome when you do.",
