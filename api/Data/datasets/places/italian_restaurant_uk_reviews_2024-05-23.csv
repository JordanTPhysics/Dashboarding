ChIJO2oS9sKxe0gRlJi3_xgmRb0,5,"My birthday meal (a lovely surprise venue booked by my son) was held here, a place I had not visited before. We all love Italian food (there were four on our party), and all our meals, from the starters through to the desserts, were fantastic - with generous portions sizes to ensure we left nicely full üòä.
Great friendly and prompt service by all wait staff, and a really nice treat at the end of my meal with a birthday dessert plate and candle - it's these kind of gestures that make an evening more special!",2024-01-24T14:21:37Z
ChIJqehhDeuxe0gRAUxL96vzLnQ,5,"We celebrated our sons 21st birthday last night, party of twelve, and we all commented on the great staff and lovely food. The welcome from the staff was great and one member took photos of our party before being seated. We had paid a small extra amount for balloons and confetti on the table which was tastefully done and this also included a birthday card from the staff and dessert of profiteroles with a candle!
The attention from the staff was not overwhelming and we were able to enjoy our meal without constant interruption to check how things were. Everyone was very friendly and didn‚Äôt rush us at all.
The only reason I have dropped a star for  atmosphere is because the music played by a live DJ was too loud, we had my 87 year old mother with us and she struggled to join in but when asked,  it was turned down.
Everyone enjoyed their meals of Diavalu and margarita  pizza, ravioli, prawn cocktail, gnocchi etc all cooked well, served beautifully and very tasty. The puddings were lovely and not too large and one guest said it was the best tiramisu she had ever tasted.
Arranging the booking was simple and we were able to tweak our reservation without penalty. Meals were all ordered in advance and name cards were given with individuals choices written on the back which helped remind everyone. The meal itself was then served promptly and the evening was a great success.",2023-06-18T09:06:43Z
ChIJqehhDeuxe0gRAUxL96vzLnQ,5,"We were served mainly by Fabio, but all members of the team we‚Äôre excellent. Professional but relaxed. The linguine with prawns and chilli was one of the best Italian meals I‚Äôve had in a very long time. I can recommend the Italian Sauvignon also, especially if you find New Zealand ones too ‚Äòheavy‚Äô.  Looking forward to returning.",2022-06-09T14:53:01Z
ChIJqehhDeuxe0gRAUxL96vzLnQ,5,"The bruschetta starter is very tasty. Surprised that it is only one piece but we split it in half to share between two of us.
The mushroom tagliatelle pasta is exquisite, very creamy and filling.
The tiramisu is very light. Again, a bigger portion was expected but it is still very nice.

A great place to visit if you‚Äôre looking for some good quality food and nice service. Portion sizes are on the small side.",2022-05-05T08:13:10Z
ChIJ73ryF8Sxe0gRDCOiDH6lFeU,5,"Found this little GEM of a restaurant while staying in Manchester. Definitely one of the absolute best Italian meals I've had as a coeliac outside of Italy. I don't take very good pictures of food but honestly it was really tasty and my husband really enjoyed his non GF dishes too.

My mushrooms in cheese sauce starter had incredible taste, the pasta was cooked perfectly with a nice amount of sauce (and huge portion!) And the GF garlic pizza bread was lovely and crispy on the edges.

They can do GF penne for pretty much all of the pasta dishes, GF pizza's and a GF garlic bread (on a pizza base). Most of the rest of the menu can be adapted other than a few things (like Arancici or Lasagne)

The staff were SO lovely and helpful too. We were served by Lee and Mariano who couldn't do enough for us.

The restaurant is so cute and pretty as well and we were lucky enough to sit outside on the terrace part with fairy lights all around us (in my picture)

Check it out on TripAdvisor for more pics of how lovely the restaurant is üòä",2024-05-14T19:35:53Z
ChIJ73ryF8Sxe0gRDCOiDH6lFeU,5,"Had a memorable evening with my family. The evening started with a delicious dinner at Dom's and ends with The Halle Orchestra concert.
The pate antipasti was cooked to perfection...rich & smooth with a intense aroma of fresh chicken liver.
The recommended pasta Gamberoni e Zucchine was done perfectly with the full flavours of prawns & sauce absorbed completely.
Had Zuppa di Pesce (special dish that evening) where the tomato based broth was infused with the full flavours of the various seafood completely.
Paired the above with a bottle of Gavi to compete the dinner.
Highly recommended!",2024-05-16T21:43:24Z
ChIJ73ryF8Sxe0gRDCOiDH6lFeU,5,"Took my girlfriend here for our date night and we weren‚Äôt disappointed whatsoever, firstly on arriving we were greeted by one of the lovely servers, he gracefully guided us to our table which was situated in a nice private area next to a window. I can‚Äôt get over the atmosphere in this place! romantic, cozy and authentic. The music playing at just the right level, the ambiance, the traditional Italian decor and feel! love love love.

Such a vast menu offering a wide array of delicious cuisine,we were stuck for choice. We ended up ordering :

Garlic bread with cheese - absolutely delicious and
addictively moorish, crispy base, gooey stretchy cheese and a drizzle of olive oil, honestly stunning.

Bruschetta - simple but elegant, bursting with flavour and tasted so fresh.

Paccheri genovese - al dente pasta tubes with melt in your mouth slowly cooked beef, need I say more? this was an incredible dish, a blessing to my stomach, packed with divine flavour and texturally a masterpiece.

Spaghetti Carbonara - subtle but a delectable taste, creamy and decadent, definitely a must try

Saut√©ed Potatoes - the perfect little side order, garlicky, buttery and mouth-watering.

Overall Dom‚Äôs Italia left me and my girlfriend feeling over the moon with our choice for date night, the staff went above and beyond to make sure we felt as comfortable as possible and the service is like none other we‚Äôve experienced at other businesses, if you don‚Äôt try this place you‚Äôd be doing a disservice to yourself and your tastebuds.

We will be returning.",2024-05-09T11:52:20Z
ChIJn43aCL-xe0gR6Kx9FNi_hFU,5,"Best Italian we've had in a long time, Beef Brisket Pappardelle was beautiful as was the folded Garlic and cheese bread... highly recommend with friendly, helpful staff",2024-02-05T21:07:37Z
ChIJn43aCL-xe0gR6Kx9FNi_hFU,5,"Great food, we had two pasta mains with prawn and crawfish and the frutti di mare, both delicious and the deserts were lush, affogato and lemon tart.
Hasan, our waiter, was very friendly and helpful, great service from him.",2024-02-19T11:27:00Z
ChIJ6eP9yNixe0gR5QK23VFLf2g,5,"Stunning Italian food, starters, mains and desert 5/5, you can really taste the quality ingredients!! The service was brilliant, friendly and fast, the waiters kept an eye on topping up our wine glasses. Lovely relaxed atmosphere inside for a busy Friday evening. 100% will be visiting again.",2024-03-16T22:29:04Z
ChIJ6eP9yNixe0gR5QK23VFLf2g,5,"Came for late lunch, we ordered 2 pizza starters to share, Ghiottona ( with pumpkin sauce ) and Diavola. Both were thin and absolutely delicious, gone in minutes because they were that good.

For mains we ordered Lamb Ragu with Pappardelle, the slow cooked lamb was very tender and mouth watering, a helping of black pepper‚Ä¶.spot on. Special for the day Ravioli, fish and spinach. Presented beautifully and tasted just as good. Diced prawns with pasta in tomato and brandy sauce and the final dish was small shell pasta with Italian sausages, porcini and truffle sauce. We thoroughly enjoyed our meals, and staff were very friendly and attentive. If you‚Äôre in Manchester and fancy authentic Italian food, then Vero Moderno is the place to go. We highly recommend this place.",2024-04-20T22:01:32Z
ChIJ6eP9yNixe0gR5QK23VFLf2g,5,"It‚Äôs hard to stand out as an Italian restaurant in Manchester as we have so many very good ones but this place for me does have that bit more about it. No sight of the old British classic lasagne as the chef likes to stick to creating fresh pasta, grilled meat and seafood as opposed to oven cooking lasagnes for long drawn out cooking. My main was Risotto with braised beef and was outstanding as were the pizza and garlic bread. Never thought I‚Äôd say this whilst giving a review of an Italian restaurant but the Burger was also out of this world. It‚Äôs served just pink as a tribute to the quality of the meat and it does not disappoint.

Please do try this the food and staff are amazing. üëåüèª",2023-11-11T16:39:56Z
ChIJ8Y8rDeqxe0gRwcQuv7Hf0AA,4,"Fumo has a great location in a busy street in town and is set back from the busy Oxford Road intersection.
A nice entrance gives a great view of the bar which spans the rear of the restaurant with impressive mirror backing and lighting that shows off the high end spirits and the signature oversized bottles too.
Beautiful marble decor with soft wooden accents and stunning lampshades resembling jelly fish give a nice atmosphere.
Service is good and you can tell the wait staff try hard.
The food is as you expect, we ate 2 courses which came to ¬£30 per person including. Service
Our order:
Bruschetta
Beetroot carpaccio
Garlic bread starter
Main dishes:
Penne Arabiatta
Calzone
Tagliatelle, Ragu

Everything was hot, tasted great and we had a bunch of empty plates.

We ate at 6:30 on a Sunday when it was fairly quiet due to heavy rain.",2023-12-10T22:03:06Z

ChIJ60SUrcOue0gRYrYWIaU4pWo,4,"Went to Cibo  a Tuesday night after seeing the restaurant recommended in a reddit post about romantic places to dine in Manchester.

We ordered the bruschetta and beef cappacio for starters. Our mains were the flambe pasta, and tagliatelle meatballs followed by the sharing dessert for 2. The food was delicious. My only gripe about the service was that we were without some water for a time without being offered some more.

The atmosphere is nice, but I'm not sure I would have classified it was romantic. It felt a little Instagram-y to be honest. However, the food was great.",2023-02-08T23:57:04Z
ChIJ60SUrcOue0gRYrYWIaU4pWo,5,"We had a really great time, we came out as a celebration as a couple. The food was really nice especially the pasta and cheesy garlic bread. We got served by a waitress called Elle and she was incredible. She was really friendly, gave us some friendly advice on the menu and was just overall a great waitress. The only negative thing was we was right near the bin and the spacing was abit compact",2024-01-19T19:51:54Z
ChIJC7luE76xe0gRD0_OCu9ShRA,5,"Lovely restaurant I a city centre of Manchester.

ChIJuSpnDMOxe0gRRBO-aNN3TVc,5,"I discovered this restaurant with my fianc√©e yesterday. We were absolutely blown away by the taste of the food and the venue - I can honestly say the best Italian I have had in a very very long time. We had a few of the starters and can say they were amazing - the Mrs fell in love with the Gamberoni alla Diavola. I had the Tagliolini lobster and the Mrs had the Spaghetti Gamberoni Piccanti for our mains and we both thoroughly enjoyed it. The lobster I must say was divine. The wines were also really good to the point we bought a bottle to take home with us to have. We can honestly say we will be coming back monthly to our new favourite haunt.

I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone and everyone!",2022-08-15T13:12:23Z
ChIJuSpnDMOxe0gRRBO-aNN3TVc,5,"Went to the San Carlo without a reservation. Decided to grab a spot at the bar while our table freed up. We were greeted by some shots on the house by the fantastic bartenders that gave us great advice on where to go in the city as we were visiting for football. Wasn‚Äôt long to get seated and ordered an antipasto with the focaccia bread which was lovely, the veal and risotto were also excellent. Highly recommend!",2023-01-03T17:50:27Z

ChIJHabN2Oexe0gR4U1hQ6VN3Ao,5,"Nice dining experience. We started with the shared platter of various appetisers; nice and fresh layout of cured meats, cheeses, olives, artichoke, cherry tomatoes and arugula. Mains followed shortly after‚Ä¶ My partner had the lobster ravioli and I had the wild boar (ragu) linguini. Everything was served quickly, hot and delicious‚Ä¶ Our pastas had perfectly balanced flavours. I was stuffed by the end of our mains. She indulged a little further with a nice slice of Tiramisu on the side of a Cappuccino. Staff were very friendly and the ambience made the meal feel a little more authentic as well! It wasn‚Äôt too busy when we visited, so not sure how much this added to our experience. We were very happy with our impromptu evening.",2023-01-03T16:28:25Z
ChIJHabN2Oexe0gR4U1hQ6VN3Ao,5,"Me and my girlfriend went to dinner at Don Marco. Everything was so nice, from service to food. Place itself is very cosy, both outside with over head infrared lamps, and inside with a really comfortable chairs and elegant decor. Servers were really nice and smiling- very italian. Garlic bread was the best I‚Äôve had in Manchester so far at an italian resturant, really tasty dough. I ordered rigatoni with pancetta and tuscan sausage with mushrooms and cream base and it was cooked to perfection, every flavour came together and it was not heavy on stomach even after having a decent portion, also ordered penne arabiata- again really flavourful. My girlfriend is a vegan and she ordered Gnocci with tomato base and I must say, it was one of the best tomato pasta sauces I have tasted in Manchester. And they had vegan cheese available too. Very rightfully prices. I believe, its the closest taste to classic italian resturants, as I could get in Manchester so far. Overall- highly recommended for a nice italian dinner. Perfect for dates.",2023-08-26T21:25:29Z
ChIJicJOJuqxe0gRgw6ZlALzDL8,4,Worth pre-booking. Very busy on arrival but after a short wait shown to table for pre-theatre meal. Excellent service and a nice prawn salad followed by very generous and delicious Pizza Mafiosa.,2022-07-03T17:04:06Z
ChIJicJOJuqxe0gRgw6ZlALzDL8,5,"Firstly, what a sauce on the raviolli!

We had dinner here last night, they had just reopened after 3 weeks shut and we were the only people in, but the waiter was very chatty but just the right amount, it seems was unfair to rate the atmosphere poorly because it was the first night back open. Im sure when people realise its back open again it will be rammed.
The food was absolutly delicious, some of the best pasta ive eaten here or in italy. Amd my daughters pizza was a huge hit aswell. Thank you for a great meal, good luck reopening.",2023-08-21T20:07:29Z

ChIJP8CAX7ixe0gRf_nYSsWAztM,5,"There‚Äôs a reason we weren‚Äôt able to just walk in and get a table on a Friday night and all the recommendations I‚Äôd heard were deserved - for fresh delicious pasta I‚Äôve not been anywhere better! The interior is quite basic but that also gives an authentic vibe, and all the staff were very welcoming from arrival and throughout. There‚Äôs a number of blackboards throughout listing special dishes and the waitress was happy to offer recommendations and customise dishes to order too, after checking with the kitchen.

The lamb skewer starter was wonderful, presented just as well as the king prawn bruschetta. The side of bread and olives was equally as good with sizeable olives and tasty oil. My main of layered pasta (think lasagne) came with a huge portion size, lots of filling and had the nicest pasta I‚Äôve ever tasted. Everyone else commented their their pasta was equally impressive and it shows that having it freshly made on the premises makes all the difference.

Given the size of the main dishes there was no need for desert but it‚Äôs a restaurant I will be sure to return to. The name and exterior appearance don‚Äôt do the incredible food justice and it‚Äôs rounded off by the brilliant staff - I can‚Äôt recommend it enough.",2022-05-16T17:58:41Z

We popped in for a quick drink and we were blown away by such a warm welcome especially from Rosanna. So much so that we decided to come back later that day for dinner and we were not disappointed. The bruschetta was gorgeous and fresh followed by the divine tagliatelle diavola and the pizza Capri which was the best pizza that we have had in years!

The pasta is cooked to perfection, firm with a subtle bite, the sauces are thick and rich, the meats are fresh and cooked to melt in your mouth, the fish comes off the bone and have an amazing texture and taste, and the pizzas are the best I have ever tasted, and I have travelled Italy. Added to the amazing food, beers, and wines, the staff are extremely polite and helpful when ordering. All come from Italy and all are eager to recommend dishes and wines suited to your tastes. If there is one Italian restaurant in the greater Manchester that I would recommend, Stocco is it. Seriously, you will not be disappointed!",2022-11-06T13:14:54Z

ChIJW86ZOl6ye0gR1NCTHzillls,5,"It was a lovely mid week day off. we fancied something different than our go to places.

From the moment you pull the door open there is an outdoor themed seating which looked lovely, delicate and warm. For some reason that warmth reminded me of the time you‚Äôd be outside on a cold raining day, you‚Äôd run home and as soon as you‚Äôre home, it‚Äôs warm, comforting and a sense of belonging - like the feeling of your loved ones waiting for you to be home.

Then you into the restaurant and greeted with a lovely smile. It‚Äôs rather overwhelming in a good way. My wife loved the vibe and energy whilst it made me love people. It sounds crazy but we as humans have become to distant in human interaction at times, these small little things gives us all little moments of hope.

pasta was soft delicate and the flavours were like a firework display full of vibrant joy.

The pan grilled salmon was lovely and the green complimented the fillet like how the stars illuminate the sky at night. The potato's should have been a little more soft though.

The pizza was almost perfect. I couldn‚Äôt help but compare it to the greatest pizza I have ever had which in the Middle East.

The staff were also very friendly and very engaging but not too intrusive.

Thank you.",2023-02-22T22:20:23Z
