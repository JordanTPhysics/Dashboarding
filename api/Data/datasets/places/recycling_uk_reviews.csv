For all the years I have been using this tip I have always found the staff to be friendly, polite, and very helpful  - come rain, hail, snow, freezing temperatures! or baking hot!.
The site is spotless and they are always on hand to help and assist me with things I can‚Äôt lift /carry or when i‚Äôm not sure which container to use.

Clearly they take pride in what they do and this is reflected in everything I‚Äôve mentioned above. They  have even made a beautiful little garden area which is full of bee friendly flowers, grasses and ornaments.  It is so creative and has obviously taken a lot of work which they didn‚Äôt need to do. Another special touch which makes this depot a pleasure to visit.
Thank you to all involved with this .... and a special mention to Chris and John in particular who‚Äôs care and love for nature and the environment are clearly apparent - such truly commendable qualities to possess.

A fantastic team, thanks to each and everyone of you - you should be very proud of yourselves üòä
