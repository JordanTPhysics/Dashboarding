A very relaxing time on the river listening to interesting stories from the skipper, watching the world go by and nibbling on the cream tea. Would highly recommend it. You can even fit in a trip to Bister Village beforehand if you want as there's enough time before disembarking at 12:30pm. We paid £7 to stay in Westgate car park which is only 5-10 mins away.

My recent experience with City Centre Cruises in Manchester was nothing short of exceptional! From the moment we stepped aboard Emmeline Pankhurst, it was evident that this was going to be an unforgettable journey.

Firstly, the food was outstanding! A delectable selection that not only tantalized the taste buds but also showcased the culinary expertise of the onboard chefs.

Yet, what truly made this experience extraordinary was the impeccable hospitality provided by Amon and Sarah. They epitomized cruise hospitality at its finest! Their warmth, attentiveness, and genuine care for every guest onboard added an extra layer of delight to the entire cruise.

Amon and Sarah's professionalism and friendliness were unparalleled. They effortlessly catered to every need, ensuring everyone felt welcomed and pampered throughout the journey. Their knowledge about the cruise, coupled with their enthusiasm, enhanced the overall experience significantly.

The ambiance onboard was delightful, the views of Manchester from the cruise were stunning, and the service was top-notch. But it was truly Amon and Sarah who elevated this experience to something truly memorable.",2023-11-24T17:38:40Z

The experience was delightful from booking right through to the excursion itself. Having adopted a gluten free approach in between making the booking and the trip itself, Jess couldn’t have been more helpful in making the change.

On the day, the setting in the boat was lovely, the food exceeded expectations and the service was spot on. Two hours just flew by and it was a very relaxing outing. I’m six feet tall and any anxieties that I had about being squashed in were completely unnecessary as the seating and space was appropriate and very adequate.
