The guys running the trip were friendly and it was simple to just pay on board. However, when it’s 15 mins in one direction and then 15 mins back, it goes very quickly and we weren’t sure it was quite worth the cost of the ticket. It’s mostly big houses & rowing clubs in Boughton that you see along one side of the river before the boat turns just after Dee Banks School and heads back to where you started. Parts of the commentary were interesting & a way to learn more about the history of Chester. I think the 2 hour cruise is probably more worth the money.\nThey do have lots of really detailed accessibility information on their website though & have toilets on board but we didn’t use them.",

I must say we were very pleased with everything . All the staff were very polite , respectful ,friendly & pleasant . The barge diner was very clean & well set out. We had a three course  pre booked lunch with soup, roast chicken / beef to follow with a choice of deserts . Wine , spirits , hot & cold drinks available to order . The whole meal was expertly cooked & presented everything was perfect a reflection of the skill of the catering staff and waitress attendance . The barge diner is equipped with a flushing toilet . Access onto the barge for very tall people may be a little awkward in order not to hit their head but that said just have to be a little careful. We were fortunate it was a sunny day so the views were that much better . The sail lasted around three hours sailing from the birthing mid point along the canal in both directions .\nThank you for the experience we had and would recommend the venue without exception.",

They indeed offered my family a great Loch ness experience and even in the cloudy, rainy conditions we still saw some breathtaking scenery from our indoor seating. We booked the 1 hour tour on-line and was greeted by pleasant and friendly staff who portrayed a family feel and settled everyone down ready for the cruise. With easy boarding, an informative narrative, and plenty of interaction we all agreed that we did make those memories they claimed we would which we will not forget for a while. They offer a number of cruises which are all, in my view, value for money, the only downside is having to park at the other end of town as no parking available at site. That said it is not a long walk and you get to see the locks and road bridge and other things that Fort Augustus has to offer. Fully recommended and well worth the 5 stars.",

              "text": "This is an award winning, 5-star cruise company and I whole heartedly agree with the owners statement. They indeed offered my family a great Loch ness experience and even in the cloudy, rainy conditions we still saw some breathtaking scenery from our indoor seating. We booked the 1 hour tour on-line and was greeted by pleasant and friendly staff who portrayed a family feel and settled everyone down ready for the cruise. With easy boarding, an informative narrative, and plenty of interaction we all agreed that we did make those memories they claimed we would which we will not forget for a while. They offer a number of cruises which are all, in my view, value for money, the only downside is having to park at the other end of town as no parking available at site. That said it is not a long walk and you get to see the locks and road bridge and other things that Fort Augustus has to offer. Fully recommended and well worth the 5 stars.",

For £39 for two adults, this felt like an incredible value.\n\nWe booked 25 minutes before the boat ride, which got us fantastic seats on the top deck at the front – the perfect spot for views and photos. The live guided tour was informative, clear, and really entertaining! I loved learning about the history of the landmarks along the river.\n\nThe boat ride was so relaxing, giving us a whole new perspective on London. It's surprisingly tranquil from the water! The whole trip took about two hours, perfect for enjoying the beautiful weather. We now have a list of interesting pubs to try, thanks to our guide.\n\nWe'll absolutely do this again and spend more time exploring Greenwich next time. I'd highly recommend this cruise to anyone visiting London.",
