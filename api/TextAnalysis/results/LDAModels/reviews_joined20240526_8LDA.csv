My recent experience with City Centre Cruises in Manchester was nothing short of exceptional! From the moment we stepped aboard Emmeline Pankhurst, it was evident that this was going to be an unforgettable journey.

Firstly, the food was outstanding! A delectable selection that not only tantalized the taste buds but also showcased the culinary expertise of the onboard chefs.

Yet, what truly made this experience extraordinary was the impeccable hospitality provided by Amon and Sarah. They epitomized cruise hospitality at its finest! Their warmth, attentiveness, and genuine care for every guest onboard added an extra layer of delight to the entire cruise.

Amon and Sarah's professionalism and friendliness were unparalleled. They effortlessly catered to every need, ensuring everyone felt welcomed and pampered throughout the journey. Their knowledge about the cruise, coupled with their enthusiasm, enhanced the overall experience significantly.

The ambiance onboard was delightful, the views of Manchester from the cruise were stunning, and the service was top-notch. But it was truly Amon and Sarah who elevated this experience to something truly memorable."

From the moment I walked through the doors, I felt welcomed and encouraged. Adam and the other coaches here are not just experts in BJJ but also fantastic teachers. They break down complex techniques into manageable steps, making it accessible for beginners while challenging advanced practitioners to push their limits.

The facilities are superb. It's clean, well-maintained, and has all the equipment you could possibly need. They've created a safe and inclusive environment where people of all skill levels and backgrounds can come together to learn and grow.

What I think sets Factory apart is the sense of camaraderie among the members. Everyone is genuinely supportive and willing to help each other improve. It might sound cheesy but It's not just a gym, it's a family. Training here has not only improved my physical fitness but also my mental resilience and confidence.

The class schedules are flexible, with days and evening classes accommodating even the busiest of schedules. Whether you're a working professional, a student, or a parent, you'll find a suitable class time.

In addition to regular classes, Factory offers various seminars and special events. These are incredible opportunities to learn from world-class instructors and deepen your knowledge of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

If you're considering learning BJJ, I highly recommend giving Factory a try. I'm proud to be a part of this incredible community, and I look forward to many more years of training and growth here."

On the 2nd April 2024, we reached out to Utility Bidder in order to assist us in finding a better rate for our gas and electric supplier at our commercial property.

I spoke with, who I thought, was a great member of staff - really helpful. Little did I know, it was just part of their sales tactics.

They first started by getting the best possible prices from our current supplier, before tendering our requirements out to their network.

Within a few minutes, she come back to me with prices (which weren't too bad in all honesty).

In the meantime, I said I was going to be speaking to my existing supplier to find out their best prices - the colleague I spoke with informed me she already had done, and they were the initial prices and not to contact them (I was confused as to who she spoke with initially).

In the meantime, I'd already poke with my existing supplier and requested a price from them, but because their member of staff told me that they'd alreadyspoke to them and got the prices, I continued to enter an agreement with Utility Bidder and our new supplier.

I then received the prices from my current supplier, who came in a A LOT cheaper than Utility Bidder had actually told me (when I mean cheaper, I mean over 75%). When I queried this, I was informed by their customer service that my supplier wouldn't put me on this contract due to me having a low credit score (due to being a new business).

I checked with my supplier if the credit check would impact the decision on me taking out this new contract, where I was informed that the credit check WOULD NOT impact the new prices and contract.

So, in conclusion - I was lied to by two members of Utility Bidder's staff in order to get me to stick with them, than my existing supplier.

If you do use them, do your own due diligence and ignore what they say until you have your own evidence to show that they are cheaper."

""We recently sent this email to you which unfortunately was missing some elements of your account's details, please find below your revised update.

As you know, the last year has been extremely challenging for all businesses. One such impact of these exceptional events is that they have created significant additional costs for the supply of your energy. We have done everything we can to mitigate this financial impact and to date, we have absorbed these additional costs into our agreed energy supply rates. In light of the significant and ongoing situation, it is regretfully unsustainable for us to continue to absorb these additional costs.

We’re getting in touch with you as your energy consumption for the period 10/02/2020 to 09/08/2022 is significantly different from your estimated yearly consumption. Consequently, we are writing to advise you of some additional reconciliation fees you will receive in your next bill and the options available to help you mitigate the impact of these charges.
What are Reconciliation Fees?
At the start of your contract, we set your agreed supply rates based on the estimated yearly consumption figures that you provide us. We purchase energy based on these consumption figures to ensure you get a competitive price in line with available market rates at that time, giving you certainty over your energy prices for the duration of your contract.

In clause 11 of our Business Terms & Conditions, we advise Corporate Business customers that there is a reconciliation fee that will be incurred if your consumption is outside the range of 90/110% of your estimated yearly energy usage.  This charge reflects the additional costs incurred if we have to balance your energy requirements outside of this tolerance range, either purchasing the shortfall from the market or selling the surplus energy at a price different to that when the contract was agreed. The reconciliation charges we calculate use the actual market prices observed during the period of the calculation. Many business energy suppliers have similar clauses in their contracts.

What this means for you
As your energy consumption for the period is outside of your contracted tolerance limit of 90/110, your account is due to incur a reconciliation fee of £330.84. These charges will be applied to your next bill.""

Dear volunteers and team at EIC. I just wanted to express my written gratitude to each of you including our dear Imam Muhammad, Shaykh Fahim, Shaykh Muhammad Saleh, Ustadh Nouman and every single volunteer who made this Ramadan a tremendously smooth spiritually uplifting month full of khayr.

May Allah swt allow it to weigh heavy on your scale of good deeds and a means by which we all attain maghfirah and jannatul firdaus through His Mercy.

From the beautiful Quran recitation, to the class from Ustadh Nouman at the end, the delicious iftaars, the organised car parking, the well maintained cleanliness of the bathrooms, the openness to families especially younger children, the crèche facilities upstairs and everything in between. Firstly, we thank Allah (swt) and secondly each of you including those behind the scenes who many may not see but Allah (swt) knows about.

JazakumAllah khayr"

The site is spotless and they are always on hand to help and assist me with things I can’t lift /carry or when i’m not sure which container to use.

Clearly they take pride in what they do and this is reflected in everything I’ve mentioned above. They  have even made a beautiful little garden area which is full of bee friendly flowers, grasses and ornaments.  It is so creative and has obviously taken a lot of work which they didn’t need to do. Another special touch which makes this depot a pleasure to visit.
Thank you to all involved with this .... and a special mention to Chris and John in particular who’s care and love for nature and the environment are clearly apparent - such truly commendable qualities to possess.

A fantastic team, thanks to each and everyone of you - you should be very proud of yourselves 😊

The only reason I have dropped a star for  atmosphere is because the music played by a live DJ was too loud, we had my 87 year old mother with us and she struggled to join in but when asked,  it was turned down.
Everyone enjoyed their meals of Diavalu and margarita  pizza, ravioli, prawn cocktail, gnocchi etc all cooked well, served beautifully and very tasty. The puddings were lovely and not too large and one guest said it was the best tiramisu she had ever tasted.
Arranging the booking was simple and we were able to tweak our reservation without penalty.

Definitely one of the absolute best Italian meals I've had as a coeliac outside of Italy.

My mushrooms in cheese sauce starter had incredible taste, the pasta was cooked perfectly with a nice amount of sauce (and huge portion!) And the GF garlic pizza bread was lovely and crispy on the edges.

They can do GF penne for pretty much all of the pasta dishes, GF pizza's and a GF garlic bread (on a pizza base). Most of the rest of the menu can be adapted other than a few things (like Arancici or Lasagne)

The staff were SO lovely and helpful too. We were served by Lee and Mariano who couldn't do enough for us.

The restaurant is so cute and pretty as well and we were lucky enough to sit outside on the terrace part with fairy lights all around us (in my picture)

Such a vast menu offering a wide array of delicious cuisine,we were stuck for choice. We ended up ordering :

Garlic bread with cheese - absolutely delicious and
addictively moorish, crispy base, gooey stretchy cheese and a drizzle of olive oil, honestly stunning.

Bruschetta - simple but elegant, bursting with flavour and tasted so fresh.

Paccheri genovese - al dente pasta tubes with melt in your mouth slowly cooked beef, need I say more? this was an incredible dish, a blessing to my stomach, packed with divine flavour and texturally a masterpiece.

Spaghetti Carbonara - subtle but a delectable taste, creamy and decadent, definitely a must try

Sautéed Potatoes - the perfect little side order, garlicky, buttery and mouth-watering.

Overall Dom’s Italia left me and my girlfriend feeling over the moon with our choice for date night, the staff went above and beyond to make sure we felt as comfortable as possible and the service is like none other we’ve experienced at other businesses, if you don’t try this place you’d be doing a disservice to yourself and your tastebuds.

We had dinner here last night, they had just reopened after 3 weeks shut and we were the only people in, but the waiter was very chatty but just the right amount, it seems was unfair to rate the atmosphere poorly because it was the first night back open. Im sure when people realise its back open again it will be rammed.
The food was absolutly delicious, some of the best pasta ive eaten here or in italy. Amd my daughters pizza was a huge hit aswell. Thank you for a great meal, good luck reopening."

There’s a number of blackboards throughout listing special dishes and the waitress was happy to offer recommendations and customise dishes to order too, after checking with the kitchen.

The lamb skewer starter was wonderful, presented just as well as the king prawn bruschetta. The side of bread and olives was equally as good with sizeable olives and tasty oil. My main of layered pasta (think lasagne) came with a huge portion size, lots of filling and had the nicest pasta I’ve ever tasted. Everyone else commented their their pasta was equally impressive and it shows that having it freshly made on the premises makes all the difference.

Given the size of the main dishes there was no need for desert but it’s a restaurant I will be sure to return to. The name and exterior appearance don’t do the incredible food justice and it’s rounded off by the brilliant staff - I can’t recommend it enough."

From the moment you pull the door open there is an outdoor themed seating which looked lovely, delicate and warm. For some reason that warmth reminded me of the time you’d be outside on a cold raining day, you’d run home and as soon as you’re home, it’s warm, comforting and a sense of belonging - like the feeling of your loved ones waiting for you to be home.

Then you into the restaurant and greeted with a lovely smile. It’s rather overwhelming in a good way. My wife loved the vibe and energy whilst it made me love people. It sounds crazy but we as humans have become to distant in human interaction at times, these small little things gives us all little moments of hope.

pasta was soft delicate and the flavours were like a firework display full of vibrant joy.

The pan grilled salmon was lovely and the green complimented the fillet like how the stars illuminate the sky at night. The potato's should have been a little more soft though.

The pizza was almost perfect. I couldn’t help but compare it to the greatest pizza I have ever had which in the Middle East.

The staff were also very friendly and very engaging but not too intrusive.

Thank you."

The installation process began with Mark, who is regarded as their top electrician. While I appreciate the hard work and dedication, I noticed that his work was rushed and some details were left incomplete. I raised this concern with Chris, and to my surprise, he took immediate action to rectify the situation. He assured me that he would get it sorted to high standards that Eco Renewables Group Limited are well known for.

Although it did take a little time to get the skirting sorted, I was more than impressed with the level of commitment Chris and Marcus displayed. They truly went above and beyond to turn my solar roof into something akin to a sleek Tesla roof. Their attention to detail and dedication to achieving a flawless finish were evident throughout the process. I couldn't have been happier with the final result. The solar panels looked seamless and aesthetically pleasing, enhancing the overall appearance of my home.

Moreover, I appreciate how Eco Renewables Group Limited values customer satisfaction. Chris's willingness to listen to my concerns and take swift action demonstrated that their commitment to providing top-notch service is more than just a marketing claim.

In conclusion, I highly recommend Eco Renewables Group Limited for solar panel installation, thanks to the outstanding efforts of Chris amd Marcus & team (roofers). While the initial work may have faced some challenges, their dedication, attention to detail, and commitment to excellence turned the experience into a resounding success. My sleek solar roof is a testament to their expertise and customer-focused approach."
